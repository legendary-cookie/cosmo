# Cosmoclient for minecraft
A WIP minecraft pvp client.

# Please note: BASED ON HYPERIUM
This started of as a fork of the [hyperium](https://github.com/hyperiumclient/hyperium) minecraft client by [sk1er LLC](https://sk1er.club). Nowadays, I only use their eventbus, command and config systems. I will try to implement my own stuff for the eventbus (or another library dunno) and the other systems.

# Please note:
Some elements of this client were taken from [Eric Golde](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCDO0hEkGSvujLnb3cZb0XCA) and his tutorial series for Mod coder pack clients!
