# Cosmoclient for minecraft
A WIP minecraft pvp client.

# Please note: HEAVILY BASED ON HYPERIUM
This started of as a fork of the [hyperium](https://github.com/hyperiumclient/hyperium) minecraft client by [sk1er](https://sk1er.club). Nowadays, I only use their eventbus, command and config systems. 

# Credits:
* Bowser0000: [Danker's Skyblock mod](https://github.com/bowser0000/SkyblockMod)
* Some small mods from Eric Golde's server. Credits will be added sometime later.
* Symt: [Bazaar Notifier](https://github.com/symt/BazaarNotifier)
* MinecraftForge ([Github](https://github.com/MinecraftForge)): Some parts used to port mods, including but not limited to:
  * Forges configuration system (Only used for porting forge mods)
  * Several events
  * Other minor stuff
