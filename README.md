# Cosmoclient for minecraft
needed for releases and updating stuff
# Please note: HEAVILY BASED ON HYPERIUM
This started of as a fork of the [hyperium](https://github.com/hyperiumclient/hyperium) minecraft client by [sk1er](https://sk1er.club). Nowadays, I only use their eventbus, command and config systems.
