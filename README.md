# Cosmoclient for minecraft
A WIP minecraft pvp client.

# Please note: HEAVILY BASED ON HYPERIUM
This started of as a fork of the [hyperium](https://github.com/hyperiumclient/hyperium) minecraft client by [sk1er](https://sk1er.club). Nowadays, I only use their eventbus, command and config systems. I will try to implement my own stuff for the eventbus (or another library dunno) and the other systems.
